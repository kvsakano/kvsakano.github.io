We demo'd our interactive Mario Kart (SNES) game alongside four trained models:

1. Fast Mario, trained for completing a loop as quickly as possible
2. Safe Mario, trained to stay on the road and drive under a specified speed limit
3. Weird Mario, a model that did not finish training and exhibits some peculiar behavior
4. Bad Mario, a model that does not finish the loop.
