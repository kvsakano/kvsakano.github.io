  abstract = {We report 11 yr of spectroscopic monitoring of the M-type asymptotic giant branch star η Gem, a semiregular variable and a known spectroscopic binary with a period of 8.2 yr. We combine our radial velocities with others from the literature to provide an improved spectroscopic orbital solution, giving a period of 2979 d, which we then use to predict past times of eclipse. We examine archival photometry from amateur variable star observers, and other sources, and find many instances of dimmings that occurred at the right time. This confirms previous indications that the system is eclipsing, and it now ranks among those with the longest known periods. No secondary eclipses are seen. The ∼0.4 mag eclipses that last about 5 months are much too deep to be produced by a stellar companion. We propose instead that the companion is surrounded by a large disc that is at least 1.5 au in diameter but is likely larger. We predict the centre of the next eclipse will occur on New Year’s Day, 2029.}

  abstract = {We present a framework for including humanreadable specifications in the design of black-box autonomous systems, or systems whose construct are prohibitively complex to analyze or intuit. By integrating parametric Signal Temporal Logic (pSTL), we can systematically evaluate and refine deep reinforcement learning policies to ensure compliance with predefined system specifications. Our approach is tested in a simulated autonomous driving environment, where we train a deep reinforcement learning agent in Mario Kart SNES using Proximal Policy Optimization. The agent is evaluated based on its ability to navigate a structured driving course while satisfying a set of a priori requirements; this evaluation is performed by writing and solving the parameters in a pSTL statement. This work contributes to the broader effort of bridging formal methods and data-driven learning, providing insights for researchers and operators alike in developing AI based controllers for real-world autonomous systems.},
