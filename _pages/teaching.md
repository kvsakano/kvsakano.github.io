### Graduate Teaching Assistant - UMD College Park
*CMSC 434: Human-Computer Interactions (Fall 2023 - Present)*

As a Graduate Teaching Assistant for the CS department's upper-level undergraduate HCI course, I provide iterative, one-on-one feedback to student teams developing interactive app prototypes following the HCI Lifecycle. I collaborate closely with the course instructor to design new problem contexts and exam questions, guide students in applying user-centered design principles, and support their end-to-end project development process.

I also co-developed a new project context focused on **personal budgeting and financial management**, which offers students a realistic and socially relevant design challenge that complements the existing project options. Additionally, I contributed to the development of a **new AI-centered lecture series** introduced in Fall 2025, expanding the course's coverage to include emerging topics in human-AI interactions.

### Guest Lecturer - UMD College Park
*ENAE 380: Flight Software Systems (Fall 2024)*

I delivered a guest lecture introducing the fundamentals of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)**, including the **Markov Decision Process (MDP)** framework, policy optimization, and reward-based learning. The session incorporated **interactive examples using Mario gameplay** to illustrate state transitions, explorationâ€“exploitation tradeoffs, and agent training dynamics in a familiar environment. I designed and implemented an **interactive Google Colab assignment** that allowed students to experiment with different object placements to observe their impact on the optimal policy of the model.
