I am a 3rd year PhD student in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.umd.edu/people/kvsakano) at the University of Maryland at College Park advised by [Dr. Mumu Xu](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~mumu/). I am broadly interested in formal verification and model checking of autonomous cyber-physical systems. My work combines human feedback and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) methods to evaluate black-box controllers. I am passionate about machine learning transparency by bringing human operators into the loop to make autonomous robots safe for everyone :robot:

This past summer (2025), I completed an internship at the [National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START)](https://www.start.umd.edu/) where I co-authored a white paper on hacktivism, ideologically-motivated cybercrimes. My technical contributions included analyzing cyber-attack patterns in the 21st century, modeling state involvement in hacktivist cells, assessing emerging cyber threats, and developing defensive strategies.

Before my PhD, I worked as an Operations Research Analyst and Autonomous Systems Scientist with the AI & Autonomy Applications Division at NAWCAD Patuxent River (2018-2024). I also served as a visiting scientist at NASA Goddard (2021) and the Naval Research Laboratory (2019). I earned my MS in Computer Science with a focus on Computational Perception & Robotics at Georgia Tech through their [Online Master of Science in Computer Science (OMSCS)](https://omscs.gatech.edu/) program in 2023, and a BS in Physics with Astrophysics concentration from the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](https://physics.unc.edu/) in 2018.

During my undergraduate studies, I participated in a Smithsonian-funded summer research program at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center of Astrophysics in 2018. To date, [my research on pulsating binary and trinary star systems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=6ytFsFEAAAAJ&citation_for_view=6ytFsFEAAAAJ:u-x6o8ySG0sC) is my most cited work :star2:
